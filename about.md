## What is FrAppSec?

_FrAppSec_ is an effort to fill the gap of the existing projects dealing with the subject of application security. It started because recurring themes were observed across application security initiatives which can be abstracted and reused. 

It's a blueprint for how things should be done in order to have a consistent end to end approach on application security. It provides the vocabulary, paradigms and documentation needed.

## Version number convention

At a minimum, we aim for a yearly release cycle. Each release will be named after the release year followed by the '.' character and the version number.

Example: 2016.1 (1st release of the year 2016), 2016.2 (2nd release of the year 2016), etc.

Exception: 2016.0 - the version number used during development
