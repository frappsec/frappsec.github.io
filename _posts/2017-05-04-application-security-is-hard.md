**FrAppSec** is the blueprint providing a holistic view of the application security landscape, identifying the actors involved in the process, their needs and ways to achieve those needs. The end goal is to deliver the acceptable level of security with the minimum amount of effort.

It provides the logic and the structure needed to run a successful application security program.
